### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Electrical Engineer and Self-taught programmer, I started with Python in 2020, before switching to Java when JetBrains Academy was offered for free for 6 months. Thatâ€™s where I discovered real computer sciences and became completely addicted to programming. I have learned a lot about algorithms, graphs, data structures, OOP and different paradigms... Even math was included in the curriculum. After a year, I ended up with thousands of exercises including hundreds of code problems and quizzes of variable difficulty (from simple to insanely hard).

Here is my Profile on [JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org/profile/41405991) where activity stats can be found including completed topics, solved problems, progress by track, projects... ðŸ’ª

âš¡ I am still working as electrical engineer but will not stop coding. I am addicted, and happy with it.
